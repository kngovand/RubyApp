        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>Originally raised in Reston, VI, I moved to Littleton, CO over 15 years ago. Although my family
        has French roots, my nationality is Vietnamese and Laotian, which I am very proud of. I see Colorado as
        my home and do not plan on going anywhere! I originally went to school for Business, but I realized that
        I really enjoyed Computer Science, which is why I am now pursuing a career in programming.</p><br>

        <h2>Personal life</h2>
        <div class = "bodyFont">
        <p>Some of my passions are skiing and snowboarding; I wouldn't be a true Coloradan if I said otherwise!
        I also love cooking, working on cars, travelling, and hip-hop culture. I also love to rock climb, but I
        have taken a hiatus due to a recent injury. I used to play competitive chess when I was younger, I just
        started playing again (feel free to challenge me on Chess.com!). I am fluent in both French and English,
        we speak both languages at home everyday. If you'd like to know more about me, please ask!</p>
