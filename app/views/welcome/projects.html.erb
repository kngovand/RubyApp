            As a learning experience, I wanted to implement my own website using Ruby with HTML and CSS.<br>
            I did not add Bootstrap as I wanted the experience of building a web application from scratch,<br>
            a Bootstrap version is coming soon! For the navigation bar, I utilized static webpages as list<br>
            items and added redirect links for each corresponding page. The most difficult part about this<br>
            project was creating some sort of homepage graphical navigation menu, where I used containers<br>
            with a hover effect. The rest the project was straightforward, where I used HTML and CSS to<br>
            format and add links, images, iframes, ecetera.<br><br>

                In collaboration with my classmate, our final project for Android Application Development had<br>
                an objective of informing MSU-Denver students about activities and events throughout Auraria<br>
                Campus. The app would launch at a logon or registration screen, where we made use of Amazon's<br>
                Firebase Authentication API as an authenticator and database manager. From a main menu screen,<br>
                users were given the option to look at a map generated by Google's Map API and see where and <br>
                when events would take place. There were also two buttons, allowing students to either view,<br>
                edit, or delete activities. For more information, check out the GitHub

                Utilizing, Agile Scrum development, Dr. Beaty's CS3250 Software Development course focused <br>
                on simulating the aspects of programming as a software development team. For this particular<br>
                semester, each team had responsibilities of unit testing Dr. Clark Dollard's academic Banner<br>
                web application using NUnit by mocking variables, classes, and methods. We also implemented<br>
                automation tests that ran on Firefox Browser with Katalon Studio and Selenium WebDriver.<br>
                This application ran on Microsoft's ASP.net framework with C#.<br><br>

                Although I'm currently enrolled in this course, it has inspired me to create my own website.<br>
                However, the goal of this Web Application Architecture class differs because it focuses on<br>
                Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, and Node.js. Utilizing the Model-View-Controller pattern (MVC),<br>
                Rails allows the programmer to leave many intricacies of implementing a fully functional <br>
                web application by today's standards, and focuses more on the fundamental concepts being<br>
                taught. So far we have covered a vast amount of ideas such as validation, authentication,<br>
                relationships between entities, types of databases (relational, document-oriented), HTML,<br>
                CSS, Bootstrap, and much more... We have just covered JavaScript and I plan on adding<br>
                features to my personal website using JS!<br><br>
