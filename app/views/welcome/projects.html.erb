            As a learning experience, I wanted to implement my own website using Ruby with HTML and CSS.
            I did not add Bootstrap as I wanted the experience of building a web application from scratch,
            a Bootstrap version is coming soon! For the navigation bar, I utilized static webpages as list
            items and added redirect links for each corresponding page. The most difficult part about this
            project was creating some sort of homepage graphical navigation menu, where I used containers
            with a hover effect. The rest the project was straightforward, where I used HTML and CSS to
            format and add links, images, iframes, ecetera.<br><br>

                In collaboration with my classmate, our final project for Android Application Development had
                an objective of informing MSU-Denver students about activities and events throughout Auraria
                Campus. The app would launch at a logon or registration screen, where we made use of Amazon's
                Firebase Authentication API as an authenticator and database manager. From a main menu screen,
                users were given the option to look at a map generated by Google's Map API and see where and 
                when events would take place. There were also two buttons, allowing students to either view,
                edit, or delete activities. For more information, check out the GitHub

                Utilizing, Agile Scrum development, Dr. Beaty's CS3250 Software Development course focused 
                on simulating the aspects of programming as a software development team. For this particular
                semester, each team had responsibilities of unit testing Dr. Clark Dollard's academic Banner
                web application using NUnit by mocking variables, classes, and methods. We also implemented
                automation tests that ran on Firefox Browser with Katalon Studio and Selenium WebDriver.
                This application ran on Microsoft's ASP.net framework with C#.

                Although I'm currently enrolled in this course, it has inspired me to create my own website.
                However, the goal of this Web Application Architecture class differs because it focuses on
                Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, and Node.js. Utilizing the Model-View-Controller pattern (MVC),
                Rails allows the programmer to leave many intricacies of implementing a fully functional 
                web application by today's standards, and focuses more on the fundamental concepts being
                taught. So far we have covered a vast amount of ideas such as validation, authentication,
                relationships between entities, types of databases (relational, document-oriented), HTML,
                CSS, Bootstrap, and much more... We have just covered JavaScript and I plan on adding
                features to my personal website using JS!<br><br>
