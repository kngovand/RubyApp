                I first wanted to talk about this web application I made using Ruby 2.4.4. To implement this <br>
                website as easily as possible, I wanted to go with a design using static HTML pages and one <br>
                controller. After properly routing all the HTML pages, I implemented a navigation bar using<br>
                CSS so that it is persistent for the entire application. The rest of the implementation was<br>
                trivial, such as adding pictures, links, etc... I wanted an easy and straightforward dive<br>
                into CSS and HTML, where I was able to experience that through this side project.<br>
                Updates and a bootstrap version is coming soon!<br><br><br>

            <h2>Campus Activities Map using Kotlin</h2><br>

                The objective of this Campus Event app was to inform current MSU Denver students about activities <br>
                that would take place on Auraria Campus. The app would start on a logon screen, where the database<br>
                would correspond to the current students registered at MSU. From the login screen, students would<br>
                have to register through the Firebase database and create a new user account, where the app would<br>
                direct them to the maps home page. From there, users would have a map view and two buttons, <br>
                Activity List and Create Event. These buttons would allow students to either view, edit, <br>
                or delete activities.<br><br>
                If you are interested in reading more on the application, check out my Github <a href="https://github.com/kngovand/androidMapsProject/blob/master/README.md">readme</a>. <br><br><br>

                Using Agile Scrum development, we were assigned a team and had responsibilities of unit testing<br>
                the C# classes and files. Using Mock, these tests faked the variables for us automatically, but<br>
                the initial setup of this type of testing was often times difficult. Selenium testing was another<br>
                aspect of the class, where tests were ran in a browser such as Google Chrome or Firefox. <br><br><br>

                This particular class inspired me to make my own website. Using Ruby on Rails, we were able to<br> 
                easily implement a MVC (Model View Controller) architecture that controlled how our web app<br>
                behaved. Several topics that were discussed and taught: Object Relational Mapping, Validation,<br>
                Authentication, relationships such as Many-to-Many, types of databases (SQLite3, PostgreSQL),<br>
                HTTP, CSS, HTML, and much more... A class project is coming soon, stay tuned!<br>
